#### A [KvarQ] testsuite for ebolavirus

Please see the [KvarQ documentation], especially the [tutorial section] for
more information

All data is taken from:

"Genomic surveillance elucidates Ebola virus origin and transmission during the
2014 outbreak" -- Gire et al (2014) doi 10.1126/science.1259657

The file _extract_SNPs.py creates SNPs.csv that was used to create SNPs.xlsx,
which is the basis for the SNPs that are used in sierraleone14.py
